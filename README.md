# Recognize-Named


In this project, I will use a recurrent neural network to solve Named Entity Recognition problem. Named Entity Recognition is a common task in natural language processing systems. It serves for extraction such entities from the text as persons, organizations, locations, etc. In this project I will experiment to recognize named entities from Twitter.



A solution of this problem  will be based on neural networks, particularly, on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTMs).
